### Design Preview

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `Card` component is [not implemented](https://m3.material.io/components/cards/implementation) in Material You yet. Therefore, the `Card` design is not pretty.
> 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è The icon picture I obtained is a png, not a vector, so the [icon](https://github.com/carrot-style/carrot-android/blob/main/presentation/src/main/res/drawable/ic_splash_logo.png) quality is bad in the splash screen.
